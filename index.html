                      My fellow Americans and lovers of liberty, we find ourselves at a pinnacle moment in human history, a crossroads of two futures for humanity. One path leads into a dark winter ruled by an iron fist where even our thoughts and intent could be considered a crime, the other is a world filled with light, truth and unbridled creative expression. This is an opportunity to wield our greatest power, duty and God-given right to decide whether we shall live in a world that cherishes freedom or one that is ruled by tyranny.

                          I'm not going to bore you with details about policies that Trump will implement to perpetuate wealth & prosperity, or the manifesto that Biden will impose to enforce a communist regime, raise your taxes, take your jobs and surrender our society to globalist autocrats and ruthless dictators. I'm not going to labor on about how the Biden crime syndicate sold us out to the CCP, betrayed American patriots costing their lives and plans to make lockdowns and face muzzles a way of life. Even though it's true that evidence of these crimes has been verified and released to the public while the democrats, big tech and the media have all colluded to prevent you from seeing this evidence. I'm not going to waste your time pointing out the double standard of spending $40 million dollars, three and a half years on an investigation/impeachment against Trump for fabricated crimes that were funded by Hillary Clinton and the democrat party; all while not lifting a finger or writing a story regarding the decades of corruption that have been exposed in the Biden family. No. Instead I want to focus on what's truly at stake here: your livelihood, your life, your families lives and your constitutional rights to self expression, privacy and self protection.

                      The powers that are and ought not be, such as the media, big tech oligarchs like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and the radical left have made it clear that they are willing to lie, cheat, threat and even kill to force you to vote for their radical Marxist agenda and their bought and paid for candidate known as Kamala Harris... err.. I mean Joe Biden. They have worked tirelessly to cover up the corruption and evil of the elites and censor those who strive to expose them. This is the greatest violation of our Constitutional Liberties in human history. Only an informed populace can make decisions that have their best interests and those of our future generations in mind. This is the very reason that they have invested billions into ensuring that the majority of citizens remain uninformed. The news is not only fake, it is an enemy combatant on native soil. They are a militant arm of the Marxist agenda to destroy America's sovereignty in order to usher in a "New World Order" where the power has been concentrated into the hands of only a few at the very top. At the expense and on the backs of the average working class citizen. The atrocities they have committed on the people of this world and the innocent children are unspeakable and you would not be able to sleep if you were aware of how deeply depraved the global elites have been or what their plans for us are.

                      Trump is not a career politician, but truly a man of the people. He has delivered on the promises he has made, and what he has done behind the scenes should inspire everyone to know in their heart of hearts that Donald Trump is the leader this world needs right now. Without Trump at the helm, our culture would slip into an abyss of globalist elite aristocracy that could take decades to recover from. Trump has been the first leader to stand up against the global elites and the Coronavirus, civil unrest and economic hardship we've experienced in 2020 is all our punishment for electing him president in 2016. The global elites are afraid that Trump will win again and this will be the end of the long reign of terrorism and fear-based mind control. We have been repressed in terms of technology, medicine, education and even creative expression all because of the power lust of a few at the top of a very sick pyramid. We have been oppressed when we try to speak out or stand up against this force in order to beat down morale to the point where we give up and surrender to their rule over us. But Donald Trump has shown us that we don't need to back down and surrender our God given rights. In fact, it is they who will surrender to the will of the people. And by standing together, united under the common creed that we are a free people and we demand a free society; we have started a movement that now only requires our participation to bring into fruition this liberty for all. We can teach our children the importance of standing strong in the face of tyranny to honor and protect these God-given rights. We can rewrite the textbooks, including this new war between the people and the rulers and how the people stood up and made their voices heard.

                          So make your voice heard, on November third. Cast your vote for Trump, do your part to usher in the Golden Age and let this be the beginning of a beautiful new renaissance, the birth of a new creative spirit inspired by liberty -- a torch that radiates so brightly that all who are lost can find their way and all the world can finally find the peace and prosperity that we've always known was possible. Now is the time my friends... and the best is yet to come...
